## Concept Extraction from Exam Questions

## How It Works
1.Keyword Matching using subject-specific concept dictionaries.

2.Named Entity Recognition with spaCy to detect specific entities (like "Ashoka", "GDP").

3.TF-IDF Similarity with concept descriptions to catch semantic matches if all else fails
