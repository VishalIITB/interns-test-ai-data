## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to simulate an **LLM-driven concept extraction pipeline** that can analyze competitive exam questions (e.g., UPSC, NEET, JEE) and identify the **underlying conceptual tags** they test.

---

## How It Works

The pipeline uses a hybrid approach combining:
- **Keyword Matching**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **TF-IDF Vector Similarity**
- **(Optional) LLM Simulation for fallback**

Each question is mapped to one or more conceptual tags based on subject-specific dictionaries.
